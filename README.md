## General Information
- Boom bike is the bike US bike sharing company, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.
- The project is completed as a requirement for the Machine Learning module.
- Multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.
- The Boombikes bike rental dataset is being used.


## Conclusions
- The test set's R-squared value is 81.13 percent, whereas the train set's value is 82.71 percent, suggesting that our model accurately and broadly explains the variance on the test set. As a result, we can say that the model is good.

- Our developed model's mean squared error is almost 0 on both the training and testing datasets which suggests that the variance is accurately predicted on the test set. The significant variables were chosen using the p-values and VIF. 
  RFE was also carried out to select variables automatically.

- EDA, p-value, VIF, and RFE were used, and the statsmodels library was used to build the models.
